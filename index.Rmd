netdiffuseR at Sunbelt 2018


From the description:

> Empirical statistical analysis, visualization and simulation of diffusion and contagion processes on networks. The package implements algorithms for calculating network diffusion statistics such as transmission rate, hazard rates, exposure models, network threshold levels, infectiousness (contagion), and susceptibility. The package is inspired by work published in Valente, et al., (2015) DOI:10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.10.001; Valente (1995) ISBN:9781881303213, Myers (2000) DOI:10.1086/303110, Iyengar and others (2011) DOI:10.1287/mksc.1100.0566, Burt (1987) DOI:10.1086/228667; among others.
